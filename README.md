### Getting Started

1.Clone the repo and install the dependencies

 - [ ] To clone the repo, remember to clone just the starter branch:

**If you donâ€™t have npm installed globally, follow their installation documentation here according to your operating system: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install/

2. Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

3. In your repo, create a .env file and place for your API key. 

```API_KEY={YOUR_KEY}``` 


5. Run `npm start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000`.
